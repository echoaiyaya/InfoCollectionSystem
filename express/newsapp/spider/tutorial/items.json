Only five women have ever been nominated in the category before. Zhao is the first woman of Asian descent to get a nod \u2014 and the most nominated woman in a single year in Oscar history. She also got nominations for the film's adapted screenplay, editing and, as a producer in the best picture category.</p><p>The other directing nominees were Lee Isaac Chung for \"Minari,\" Fincher for \"Mank\" and Thomas Vinterberg for \"Another Round.\"</p><p>For performers, it's the most diverse slate of nominees ever \u2014 and a far cry from the all-white acting nominees that spawned the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag five years ago. Nine of the 20 acting nominees are people of color, including a posthumous best-actor nomination for Chadwick Boseman (\"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\"), and nods for Riz Ahmed (\"Sound of Metal\"), Steven Yeun (\"Minari\"), Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield (\"Judas and the Black Messiah\"), Leslie Odom Jr. (\"One Night in Miami\"), Viola Davis (\"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\"), Andra Day (\"The People vs. Billie Holiday\") and Yuh-Jung Youn (\"Minari\").</p><p>Davis, who won for her performance in 2016's \"Fences,\" landed her fourth Oscar nomination, making Davis the most nominated Black actress ever. Yeun is the first Asian American ever nominated for best actor.</p><p>The other nominees for best actress are: Carey Mulligan, \"Promising Young Woman\"; Frances McDormand, \"Nomadland\"; Vanessa Kirby, \"Pieces of a Woman.\"</p><p>The remaining nominees for best actor are: Anthony Hopkins, \"The Father\"; Gary Oldman, \"Mank.\"</p><p>After a pandemic year that shuttered most movie theaters, the best-picture nominees had hardly any box office to speak of. The Oscars won't just lack blockbusters, it's going forward with many movies that have barely played on the big screen at all. That leaves streaming services set to dominate Hollywood's biggest and most sought-after awards.</p><p>Netflix, as expected, led the pack with 35 nominations. The service is still gunning for its first best-picture winner, and this year has two shots in \"Mank\" and \"The Trial of the Chicago 7\" \u2014 a movie Paramount Pictures sold off during the pandemic. Netflix led last year, too, with 24 nominations, but came away with just two wins.</p><p>Other streamers were in the mix. Amazon, in particular, was well represented with \"Sound of Metal,\" \"Borat Subsequent Moviefilm\" and \"One Night in Miami.\"</p><p>The nominations were announced from London by presenters Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra Jonas. The Academy Awards would typically have happened by now but this year were postponed by two months due to the pandemic. They will instead be telecast April 25.</p><p>The film academy confirmed Monday that the show will be held at both its usual home in the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles and the city's railway hub, Union Station.</p><p>In addition to Youn, the nominees for best supporting actress are: Maria Bakalova, \"Borat Subsequent Moviefilm\"; Glenn Close, \"Hillbilly Elegy\"; Olivia Colman, \"The Father\"; Amanda Seyfried, \"Mank.\"</p><p>In addition to Odom Jr., Kaluuya and Stanfield, the nominees for best supporting actor are: Sacha Baron Cohen, \"The Trial of the Chicago 7\"; Paul Raci, \"Sound of Metal.\"</p><p>The nominees for best documentary feature are: \"Collective\"; \"Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution\"; \"The Mole Agent\"; \"My Octopus Teacher\"; \"Time.\"</p><p>The nominees for best international film are: \"Quo Vadis, Aida?,\" Bosnia and Herzegovina; \"Another Round,\" Denmark; \"Better Days,\" Hong Kong; \"Collective,\" Romania; \"The Man Who Sold His Skin,\" Tunisia.</p><p>The nominees for best original song are: \"Husavik\" from \"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga\"; \"Fight for You\" from \"Judas and the Black Messiah\"; \"Io S\u00ec (Seen)\" from \"The Life Ahead (La Vita Davanti a Se)\"; \"Speak Now\" from \"One Night in Miami\"; and \"Hear My Voice\" from \"The Trial of the Chicago 7.\"</p><p>The nominees for best animated feature: \"Onward\"; \"Over the Moon\"; \"A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon\"; \"Soul\"; \"Wolfwalkers.\"</p><p>The nominees for best original screenplay are: \"Judas and the Black Messiah,\" Shaka King and Will Berson; \"Minari,\" Lee Isaac Chung; \"Promising Young Woman,\" Emerald Fennell; \"Sound of Metal,\" Darius Marder and Abraham Marder; \"Trial of the Chicago 7,\" Aaron Sorkin.</p><p>The nominees for best costume design are: Alexandra Byrne, \"Emma\"; Ann Roth, \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\"; Trish Summerville, \"Mank\"; Bina Daigeler \"Mulan\"; Massimo Cantini Parrini \"Pinocchio.\"</p><p>The film academy and ABC will hope that the nominees can drum up more excitement than they have elsewhere. Interest in little golden statuettes has nosedived during the pandemic. Ratings for a largely virtual Golden Globes plunged to 6.9 million viewers \u2014 a 64% drop from 2020 \u2014 last month. Though on Sunday the Grammys managed to break through the Zoom trap that has bedeviled other awards shows.</p><p>With the notable exception of fueling streaming subscriber growth, the pandemic has been punishing for the movie industry. Production slowed to a crawl, blockbusters were postponed or detoured to streaming and thousands have been laid off or furloughed.</p><p>But the outlook for Hollywood has recently brightened as coronavirus cases have slid and vaccines have ramped up. Movie theaters are reopening in the U.S.'s two largest markets, New York and Los Angeles. And several larger movies \u2014 including the Walt Disney Co.'s \"Black Widow\" (May 7) \u2014 are scheduled for May and beyond.</p>"},

Before his hospitalization, he had been isolating at Windsor Castle, west of London, with the queen.<br/><br/>\nHis illness comes as the royal family has been rocked by an interview with Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry. In the explosive broadcast, Meghan, who is biracial, said the palace had failed to help her when she had suicidal thoughts and that an unidentified member of the royal family had raised \"concerns\" about the color of her baby's skin when she was pregnant with her son, Archie.<br/><br/>\nThe interview, conducted by Oprah Winfrey, divided people around the world. While many say the allegations demonstrate the need for change inside a palace that hasn't kept pace with the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, others have criticized Harry and Meghan for dropping their bombshell while Philip was hospitalized.<br/><br/>\nThe longest-serving royal consort in British history, Philip married the then-Princess Elizabeth in 1947. He and the queen have four children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.</p>"},

Two years later he was so disgusted after losing a decision to Sugar Ray Leonard \u2014 stolen, he claimed, by the judges \u2014 that he never fought again.</p><p>One of the great middleweights in boxing history, Hagler died Saturday at age 66. His wife, Kay, announced his death on the Facebook page for Hagler's fans.</p><p>\"I am sorry to make a very sad announcement,\" she wrote. \"Today unfortunately my beloved husband Marvelous Marvin passed away unexpectedly at his home here in New Hampshire. Our family requests that you respect our privacy during this difficult time.\"</p><p>Hagler fought on boxing's biggest stages against its biggest names, as he, Leonard, Hearns and Roberto Duran dominated the middleweight classes during a golden time for boxing in the 1980s. Quiet with a brooding public persona, Hagler fought 67 times in 14 years as a pro out of Brockton, Massachusetts, finishing 62-3-2 with 52 knockouts.</p><p>He fought with a proverbial chip on his shoulder, convinced that boxing fans and promoters alike didn't give him his proper due. He was so upset that he wasn't introduced before a 1982 fight by his nickname of Marvelous that he went to court to legally change his name.</p><p><strong>'A real man'</strong></p><p>\"He was certainly one of the greatest middleweights ever but one of the greatest people that I've ever been around and promoted,'' promoter Bob Arum said. \u201cHe was a real man, loyal and just fantastic person.''</p><p>Any doubts Hagler wasn't indeed Marvelous were erased on a spring night in 1985. He and Hearns met in one of the era's big middleweight clashes outdoors at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and when the opening bell rang, they traded punches for three minutes in an opening round many consider the best in boxing history.</p><p>Hagler would go on to stop Hearns in the third round, crumpling him to the canvas with a barrage of punches even as blood poured from a large gash on his own forehead that nearly caused the referee to stop the fight earlier in the round.</p><p>\u201cThat was an unbelievable fight,'' Arum said. \u201cProbably the greatest fight ever.''</p><p>Hearns said Saturday that he was thinking about Hagler and their historic fight. Hagler wore a baseball cap with the word \u201cWar'' while promoting it while on a 23-city tour with Hearns that Arum said made the fighters despise each other before they even entered the ring.</p><p>\u201cI can't take anything away from him,'' Hearns told The Associated Press. \u201cHis awkwardness messed me up, but I can't take anything away from him. He fought his heart out and we put on a great show for all time.''</p><p>Hagler would fight only two more times, stopping John Mugabi a year later and then meeting Leonard, who was coming off a three-year layoff from a detached retina, in his final fight in 1987. Hagler was favored going into the fight and many thought he would destroy Leonard \u2014 but Leonard had other plans.</p><p><strong>Split decision</strong></p><p>While Hagler pursued him around the ring, Leonard fought backing up, flicking out his left jab and throwing combinations that didn't hurt Hagler but won him points on the ringside scorecards. Still, when the bell rang at the end of the 12th round, many thought Hagler had pulled out the fight \u2014 only to lose a controversial split decision.</p><p>Hagler, who was paid $19 million, left the ring in disgust and never fought again.

Those comments were made during an interview with a Mexican broadcaster, Televisa, in 2019, but were cut by the Vatican until they appeared in a documentary last year.</p><p>While the documentary fudged the context, Francis was referring to the position he took when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires and the country's lawmakers were considering approving gay marriage, which he and the Catholic Church opposed. Then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio instead supported providing legal protections for gays in stable unions through a so-called \"law of civil cohabitation.\"</p><p>Francis told Televisa: \"Homosexual people have the right to be in a family. They are children of God.\" Speaking of families with gay children, he said: \"You can't kick someone out of a family, nor make their life miserable for this. What we have to have is a civil union law; that way they are legally covered.\"</p><p>In the new document and an accompanying unsigned article, the Vatican said questions had been raised about whether the church should bless same-sex unions in a sacramental way in recent years, and after Francis had insisted on the need to better welcome and accompany gays in the church.</p><p>In the article, the Vatican stressed the \"fundamental and decisive distinction\" between gay individuals and gay unions, noting that \"the negative judgment on the blessing of unions of persons of the same sex does not imply a judgment on persons.\"</p><p>But it explained the rationale for forbidding a blessing of such unions, noting that any union that involves sexual activity outside of marriage cannot be blessed because it is not in a state of grace, or \"ordered to both receive and express the good that is pronounced and given by the blessing.\"</p><p>And it added that blessing a same-sex union could give the impression of a sort of sacramental equivalence to marriage. \"This would be erroneous and misleading,\" the article said.</p><p>In 2003, the same Vatican office issued a similar decree saying that the church's respect for gay people \"cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual behavior or to legal recognition of homosexual unions.\"</p>"},

The maestro, known for his wild hair and bespectacled face, was long revered by the Met's audiences, singers and symphony-sized orchestra at America's cathedral of opera whose standards he helped place among the highest in the world.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nLevine, considered the foremost American conductor of his time and perhaps the most celebrated since Leonard Bernstein, led about 2,500 performances of 85 different operas since his Met debut in 1971, more than anyone else since it was founded in 1880. He also conducted some of the major orchestras of America and Europe, most notably the Munich Philharmonic and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHe stepped down as music director in 2016 after struggling with health problems, but was fired in 2018 from his reduced role with the Met after three men accused him of abusing them as teenagers as far back as 1968. His final appearance at the Met was leading a concert performance of Verdi's Requiem in 2017.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nLevine and the Met, the largest performing arts organization in the United States, reached an out-of-court settlement in 2019 resolving his lawsuit accusing the company of breach of contract and defamation and the company's countersuit. The settlement called for him to get $3.5 million.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nPeter Gelb, the Met general manager who made the decision to part ways with Levine, called the outcome \"a tragedy.\" Levine called the accusations \"unfounded\" and said he was not \"an oppressor or an aggressor.\"<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the Met said it \"honors the memory\" of Levine and acknowledged his \"undeniable artistic achievements\" but said his relationship with the opera company frayed in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nLevine worked with the greatest opera singers of his era, including Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, Renee Fleming, Anna Netrebko, Marilyn Horne, Jessye Norman, Samuel Ramey, Kathleen Battle, Frederica von Stade, Bryn Terfel, Roberto Alagna, Kiri Te Kanawa, Cecilia Bartoli, Renata Scotto, Leontyne Price and Grace Bumbry.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n\"He is one of the greatest artists of all time. He has created one of the greatest orchestras in modern history. He may be one of the greatest opera conductors who ever lived,\" Gelb told The New York Times in 2011.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/><strong>'Music chose me'<br/>\n\u00a0</strong><br/>\nLevine was respected for his conducting abilities, his penchant for eliciting the finest performances from musicians and his endless enthusiasm.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nA traditionalist, he conducted sparkling performances of venerable operas by composers including Verdi, Mozart, Puccini, Rossini and Wagner, as well as new compositions. A piano prodigy, Levine remained active as a keyboard recitalist. He worked to create an exceptional rapport with his musicians.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nDuring his career, he was bothered by health problems, notably a series of back operations. This forced him to cut back on performances and conduct while sitting down. He injured his spine in a fall while on vacation in 2011 that required surgery and left him partially paralyzed.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nComplications related to Parkinson's disease prompted Levine in 2016 to step down as the Met's full-time music director and become music director emeritus, a position in which he would still conduct. His later suspension and dismissal ended that arrangement.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n\"I sometimes say that music chose me because I can't remember my life without it,\" Levine said in a PBS documentary. \"I feel music gave me a real continuum of creative, constructive life. ... As I look around at other professions in the world, it seems that to have a life in music is the most beautiful life I could imagine.\"<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nLevine was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1943. He made his debut as a piano soloist at age 10 with the Cincinnati Symphony. After studying at the Juilliard school of music in New York, he was invited in 1963 to serve as assistant conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra under prominent conductor George Szell.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHe made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1971, conducting Puccini's Tosca. He was appointed the Met's principal conductor in 1973, its musical director in 1975 and was given the expanded role of artistic director in 1986.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n\"The crisis of how to enact opera onstage visually has some alarming facets,\" Levine once told New York magazine. \"I'm referring to productions the composer and librettist would denounce. I'm speaking of a production that uses a piece instead of presents the piece. People will say, 'Oh, Jimmy, he's so fanatic.' ... But there are so many contemporary productions that just destroy the piece, for nothing.\"<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFrom 1996 to 2000, he also led more than a dozen concerts on the popular \"Three Tenors World Tour,\" with Domingo, Pavarotti and Jose Carreras.</p><p>\u00a0</p>"},

That's nearly double the 2,724 instances reported in 2019. Online propaganda is much harder to quantify, and it's likely those cases reached into the millions, the anti-hate organization said.</p><p>The ADL, which was founded more than a century ago, said that last year marked the highest level of white supremacist propaganda seen in at least a decade. Its report comes as federal authorities investigate and prosecute those who stormed the U.S. Capitol in January, some of whom are accused of having ties to or expressing support for hate groups and anti-government militias.</p><p><strong>'Bookends'</strong></p><p>\"As we try to understand and put in perspective the past four years, we will always have these bookends of Charlottesville and Capitol Hill,\" group CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said.</p><p>\"The reality is there's a lot of things that happened in between those moments that set the stage,\" he said.</p><p>Christian Picciolini, a former far-right extremist who founded the deradicalization group Free Radicals Project, said the surge in propaganda tracks with white supremacist and extremist recruiters seeing crises as periods of opportunity.</p><p>\"They use the uncertainty and fear caused by crisis to win over new recruits to their 'us vs. them' narrative, painting the 'other' as the cause of their pain, grievances or loss,\" Picciolini told the AP. \"The current uncertainty caused by the pandemic, job loss, a heated election, protest over extrajudicial police killings of Black Americans, and a national reckoning sparked by our country's long tradition of racism has created a perfect storm in which to recruit Americans who are fearful of change and progress.\"</p><p>Propaganda, often distributed with the intention of garnering media and online attention, helps white supremacists normalize their messaging and bolster recruitment efforts, the ADL said in its report. Language used in the propaganda is frequently veiled with a patriotic slant, making it seem benign to an untrained eye.</p><p>But some flyers, stickers and posters are explicitly racist and anti-Semitic. One piece of propaganda disseminated by the New Jersey European Heritage Association included the words \"Black Crimes Matter,\" a derisive reference to the Black Lives Matter movement, along with cherry-picked crime statistics about attacks on white victims by Black assailants.</p><p>A neo-Nazi group known as Folks Front distributed stickers that include the words \"White Lives Matter.\"</p><p>According to the report, at least 30 known white supremacist groups were behind hate propaganda. But three groups \u2014 NJEHA, Patriot Front and Nationalist Social Club \u2014 were responsible for 92% of the activity.</p><p><strong>Where it occurred</strong></p><p>The propaganda appeared in every state except Hawaii. The highest levels were seen in Texas, Washington, California, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Virginia and Pennsylvania, according to the report.</p><p>Despite the overall increase, the ADL reported a steep decline in distribution of white supremacist propaganda at colleges and universities, due in large part to the coronavirus pandemic and the lack of students living and studying on campus. There were 303 reports of propaganda on college campuses in 2020, down from 630 in 2019.</p><p>Greenblatt acknowledged that free speech rights allow for rhetoric that \"we don't like and we detest.\" But when that speech spurs violence or creates conditions for normalizing extremism, it must be opposed, he said.</p><p>\"There's no pixie dust that you can sprinkle on this, like it's all going to go away,\" Greenblatt said. \"We need to recognize that the roots of this problem run deep.\"</p>"}
